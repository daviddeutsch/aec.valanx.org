# Advanced Administration

AEC has a number of powerful tools that help you with investigating or troubleshooting your system.

The [History](advanced-administration/01-history) provides you with a detailed transaction log from the notifications that payment processors send to your server.

The [Eventlog](advanced-administration/02-eventlog) is similar, but goes much further - in it, you can find a log over all events that happen in AEC.

With the built-in [Import & Export](advanced-administration/04-import-export), migrating or synchronizing data into or out of AEC is a breeze.

Finally, there are a few integrations in AEC that require files in other components to be modified. You can learn more about that under [Hacks](advanced-administration/03-hacks).

Make sure to also check the [Toolbox](toolbox/start) section of this manual for even more tools like the ones in this one.
