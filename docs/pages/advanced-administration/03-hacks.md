# Hacks

Some (very few) Micro Integrations require code hacks to allow for their desired functionality. In AEC, carrying out those hacks is a simple matter - on the first page of the MI settings, you will see a link to the otherwise hidden `Hacks` page. On that page, you can apply or remove the individual hacks with the click of a button.
