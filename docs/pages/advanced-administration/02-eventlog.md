# Eventlog

In the `Eventlog`, AEC stores all events that happen - above a certain threshold. Such events include every time a payment notification arrives or an invoice is paid and payment plan is applied.

## Eventlog MI

If you want to add your own entries to the Eventlog, you can use the Eventlog MI to do exactly that. Note here, that you can of course use the [Rewrite Engine](advanced-administration/05-rewrite-engine) to customize the messages you file with data from the user account, invoice and many further sources.
