# Editing Language Files

## Different Areas

AEC has a number of separate language files, split up according to separate areas in the component. You will most likely only need to change the frontend language file, which you will find here:

### AEC Frontend

```
/language/[language]/[language].com_acctexp.ini

So for English:

/language/en-GB/en-GB.com_acctexp.ini
```

And there are also separate files for the MicroIntegrations and Processors:

### Micro Integrations

```
/language/[language]/[language].com_acctexp.mi.[name of mi].ini

So for the English translation of the Email MI:

/language/en-GB/en-GB.com_acctexp.mi.email.ini

```

### Processors

```
/language/[language]/[language].com_acctexp.processors.[name of processor].ini

So for the English translation of the PayPal Integration:

/language/en-GB/en-GB.com_acctexp.processors.paypal.ini
```

## How to edit language files

The bigger files are broken down into sections. If you want to edit the payment plans page, simply look for a section called "PAYMENT PLANS PAGE"

```
define('_PAYPLANS_HEADER', 'Payment Plans');
```

Change 'Payment Plans' to 'Membership Options' to read as follows

```
define('_PAYPLANS_HEADER','Membership Options');
```

or to erase it completely:

```
define('_PAYPLANS_HEADER','');
```

You always want to make a language string empty as the last resort - do NOT delete the whole definition or AEC will throw an error.
