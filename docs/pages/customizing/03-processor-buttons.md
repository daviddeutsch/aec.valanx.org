# Change Processor Button Images

All of the processor images are saved in the directory:

```
/media/com_acctexp/images/site/
```

Here you can find the various processor buttons (images). Almost all of them are .png files. To change an existing one, just upload the new image (with the same name and format) to that directory.

Here is an example, lets say we want to change the PayPal Buy Now button shown below:

TODO: Image of standard PayPal Button

When I look at the source code for the plans page, I see the image has the name of gw_button_paypal.png.

On PayPal's site I found this button called btn_xpressCheckout.gif that I liked. I brought it up in an image editor, and saved the file as a .png with the same name as AEC's standard button.

After doing this I uploaded it to the directory stated above, and now I get this:

TODO: Image of modified PayPal Button

Note: Remember to backup any image files you changed, in case you upgrade AEC, you will have to re-upload them.
