# Plan Groups

![Path to Plan Groups](../../img/plan-groups-path-to.png)

`Plan Groups` are collections of `Payment Plans`.

Say, for example, your site has **50** `Payment Plans` - that would be a lot of plans to display on the signup screen! The most basic feature that groups give you is that you can split up your plans into a few of them so that instead of the long list of 50 options, they just see the groups. When they click on the group button, they will then see a page with just the plans in that group.

Another advantage of groups is that just like `Payment Plans`, they can have `Restrictions` and/or `Micro Integrations` attached to them, so by assigning them to the group, all plans in that group will inherit them.

There is a Root Group in AEC which cannot be deleted. Please be careful when editing it and keep in mind that any change you make to it will affect all plans (unless you have removed them from the root group, which is possible).
