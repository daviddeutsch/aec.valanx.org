# Plan Groups

Groups are containers for plans, they do not refer to Joomla User Groups but Plan Groups.  Think of it this way, your site has for example 50 plans, and you do not want your plans page to be that long and want to group up plans.  When you do this, a person goes to the plans page and will see the group names,   When they click on the Group Name, they will then see a page with just the plans in that group.

Another advantage of groups is that if a large number of plans have the same Restrictions and/or Micro Integrations, you can assign them to the group and they will become inherent in the plans in that group.

To access groups go to AEC Central --> Groups

The default group that comes in an AEC install is Root, Please do not delete or modify this group,

To create a new group click on the New icon.
