# Memberships

Once a user has purchased a [Payment Plan](/memberships/02-payment-plan), a new [Membership](/memberships/01-membership) is created and attached to the user account, or an existing `Membership` is updated.

AEC features an extensive [Membership Administration](/memberships/03-membership-administration) system.

You can also assign `Payment Plans` to [Plan Groups](/memberships/04-plan-groups) and save yourself a lot of work by making them share `Restrictions` and `Micro Integrations` by inheriting them from the group.
