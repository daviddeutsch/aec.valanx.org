# Welcome to the AEC documentation

Let's get started! Right away, you probably want to check out how to [Install AEC](start/01-setup).

Next up, check out the [Overview](start/02-overview) to get a grasp of the **core concepts** of AEC and find your way through the rest of the `Get Started` section from there on.

AEC has a lot of ways to **extend its functionality**, the most obvious one being Payment Processors and Micro Integrations (think of them as payment plan plugins) (maybe we should have named them that), but also the Toolbox which lets you dive deeper, get reports and carry out crazy queries.

If you're a developer and want to know how to **interface with AEC** or **develop your own extensions** to it, the [developer](developer/developer) section should be interesting to you.
