# Existing Users

First off: AEC Membership data is an addition to existing user data in Joomla. So instead of "registering members in AEC", they really are registered in Joomla and then, you attach membership data to them through AEC.

So existing users will be right at home with AEC - just lacking a membership. There are several paths you take from there:

## Give all of them a membership

This can be a bit tricky, but you can apply a membership to all existing users right after you have installed AEC and set up your plans. You can do that either by hand, or with a Supercommand (link below).

## Make a membership optional

You can, of course, also just make the membership optional - users would log in like they always do and never notice AEC until they want to pay for something. For this, just set AEC to not require a membership.

## Require a membership from now on

If you decide that you want to require a membership, existing users will, on their next login, be presented with a screen that explains to them that they need to pay to log in. AEC will take them through a standard checkout (lacking the registration part, of course, as that is not necessary anymore) and once they have paid, they can log in as they always did before.
