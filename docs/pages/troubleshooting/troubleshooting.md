# Troubleshooting

## White Screen of Death during install

The AEC package is rather large, so if you encounter problems, make sure that your upload limit in PHP is large enough. You can set it in your `php.ini` file like so:

```
; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 5M

; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize
post_max_size = 5M
```

You may also have no access to the php.ini file. If that is the case, you may have a corresponding setting in your server configuration console - if not, you need to contact customer support for this.

## "Is AEC breaking something?"

Not all problems that are in some way related to AEC (particularly access restrictions and hickups during the signup process) are not necessarily caused by AEC.

You can check whether AEC is the culprit rather easily - If you disable the `AEC Access` and `AEC Routing` plugins and the problem still persists (and you're not on one of the pages generated by AEC) then it's something else causing your issues.

## Frontend Validation

If frontend validation does not work (for example if a user can get through the confirmation page without clicking the Terms-of-Services checkbox), you most likely have a jQuery conflict. You can mitigate this by only allowing the first component or plugin that loads jQuery to do so and disabling it for all others. You can disable jQuery loading in AEC in the template settings in case you have a system plugin that loads it before AEC does.
