# Restrictions

While AEC itself does not [restrict access](start/10-access-control) to things in your Joomla CMS, it features an extensive restrictions system for internal matters. This is useful, for instance, when you want to structure your memberships in a certain way ("Only Silver Members can buy a Gold Membership") or when dealing with an existing access situation ("To become a featured editor, the user needs to purchase a special membership that is only available to existing editors.").

In [general](restrictions/01-general-restrictions), AEC allows you to restrict based on the users details or membership history. There is also a very powerful [custom restrictions](restrictions/02-custom-restrictions) system that further increases this flexibility. [Payment Plans](restrictions/03-payment-plans) and [Coupons](restrictions/04-coupon-restrictions) have a number of additional restrictions.

## Hierarchical Payment Plans

A common way to set up your payment plans is to structure them in such a way that one leads into the other, but items further down the chain can only be purchased once the previous plan has been applied to the user. You can achieve this by restricting your payment plans or plan groups.

## Legacy Access Rights

If you're just setting out with AEC, you don't yet have any subscription records to use, but you may already have properties in the user accounts that you can utilize. By restricting access to payment plans by Joomla usergroups or by other properties in the users account, you might even be able to emulate the behavior of a previous system that you had been using instead of AEC.
