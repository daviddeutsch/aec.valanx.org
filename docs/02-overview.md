## The home screen

## Quicksearch

If you need to navigate to user accounts quickly, you're going to love the Quicksearch. It's basically just what it says on the name tag - a very smart search that finds you users. What makes it great is how much stuff you can throw at it.

As you see - the standard function is that you can put in a username and get you to the users. If it only finds one match, you will get there directly (so "testuser95" would have put me through to the profile instantly), if there are multiple matches, you will see a list like the one above.

### What you can throw at it

This is the list of things the Quicksearch looks for, in this order:

  * Username or Name field
  * Email Address
  * Userid
  * Invoice Number

That way, no matter what you have on a user, just throw it in there and Quicksearch will get you to the profile.
